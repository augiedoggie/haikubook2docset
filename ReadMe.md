A simple script to generate a dash docset from the [Haiku API Documentation](https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/api/)

You must have `git`, `doxygen`, `doxygen2docset`, and `sqlite3` installed.

At the moment the script is designed to be run from the top level directory.
For example:
```
cd haikubook2docset
./build.sh
```
